Paints And Colors

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this document is to capture some knowledge around useful Flourescent Paints and the color ranges they emit.

Our Setup
---------

We have had good luck with this [Flourescent Body Paint set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009E6TE0S) from Amazon. None of us have had any allergic reactions yet!

Your mileage may vary, but we found the yellow paint to be the brightest. And we found that it emits an HSV color range of: <41.00, 45.00, 37.00> - <74.00, 229.00, 255.00>

You can initialize YerFace with this color range by adding the following flags to your command line: `--markerHSVRangeMin=[41,45,37] --markerHSVRangeMax=[74,229,255]`
