Using With Blender
==================

[YerFace](https://yerface.live/) can easily stream or export performance capture data into [Blender, the free and open 3D creation software](https://www.blender.org/) via our [offical Yerface Blender plugin](https://github.com/markleybros/yerface_blender).

FIXME - Documentation on this is very sparse at the moment. Please help improve it!
